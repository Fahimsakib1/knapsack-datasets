# Dataset Details
Two distinct datasets are used
- Dataset for Classical 0/1 Knapsack Problem.
- Dataset for Multidimensional Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem (MMKP).

Each dataset contains unique entries tailored to their respective problem types

## Classical 0/1 Knapsack Problem Dataset
- This dataset provides key information on item weights, prices, and knapsack capacity and contains 10000 entries which include columns for item weights, item prices, knapsack capacity, the best pick of item, and best price. This dataset is useful for selecting items that maximize value without exceeding the knapsack's weight limit.

## Multidimensional Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem (MMKP) Dataset
- MMKP dataset contains 3000 data points, organized into multiple groups. Each group has several items with each item assigned a single value and multiple resources. Unlike the simpler 0/1 Knapsack dataset, this dataset adds more layers of complexity by introducing multiple constraints and choices making it especially useful for tackling more advanced optimization problems.
